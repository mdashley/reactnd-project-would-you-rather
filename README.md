# Would You Rather

This is a simple Would You Rather application that allows you to login as a user, view polls, create polls, vote and view a leaderboard.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of starter data, which can be found in [_DATA.js_](src/utils/_DATA.js). All changes to the data will only be persisted in your local session.

## Create React App
